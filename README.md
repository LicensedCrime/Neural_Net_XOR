# Neural_Net_XOR
+ For all who is sick of all cr*ppy python documentations and love Javascript

# Setup
+ Just run the index.html
+ ANN:format([...]) formats the neural network, no matter how many layers or parameters you need.
+ ANN:feed(input) takes a 2-dimensional array as input.
+ ANN:train(output) takes a 2-dimensional array as input. weights get calculated based on the previous feed.
+ ANN:get() returns the output for the given feed.

# TODO
+ (visual presentation.... maybe some time...)
